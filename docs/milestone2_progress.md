# Tasks for M2:

* [Tom, Youngseon]: Forward mode implementation (dual numbers: with addition, multiplication overloads)
* [Lyla]: Operation overloads: subtraction, division, power, the unary operations such as negation, elemental functions including exponential and trig functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
* [Isaac]: Pytest test suite, Should test a root-finding algorithm (e.g. Newton's method) that requires calculation of the Jacobian.
* [Mina]: CI, code coverage, and PyPI (test.pypi.org) setups on (including a pyproject.toml file)
* [everyone]: Documentation
* [everyone]: Proposal for additional feature(s)

## What our group did so far here 

* Isaac
    * Together Tom, I worked on the first draft of the M1 documentation. We touched on all the sections. After we received the feedback, I divided the work for our members, and I redid documentations for implementation and license.  

* Tom
    * I worked on these sections on the first draft of our project proposal: Intro, background, how to use, and implementation.

* Mina
    * Edited intro & background of M1 documentation after feedback

* Lyla:
    * I revised all of the documentation sections after receiving feedback on M1.

* YoungSeon
    * Created the computational graph and documented foundations for AD (dual number,etc) and software organization structure.
